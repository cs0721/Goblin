            Is it better to live forever or to finally be able to die? Kim Shin (Gong Yoo) is a decorated military general during the
            Goryeo Dynasty who is betrayed by the jealous king he served. When Kim Shin is faced with death instead of honor after
            fighting a mighty battle, God turns Kim Shin into a goblin instead, tasked with protecting certain people from a life of
            misery. But immortality is wearing on Kim Shin, and he longs to find the prophesied human bride who can set his soul free.
            Kim Shin becomes accidental roommates with Wang Yeo (Lee Dong Wook), the grim reaper who ushers people’s souls into the
            afterlife. Kim Shin’s nephew, Yoo Deok Hwa (Yook Sungjae), is a rebellious chaebol heir whose family has been caretakers of
            the goblin for many generations. Ji Eun Tak (Kim Go Eun) is a high school senior whose mother was saved from an accident by
            Kim Shin 19 years ago, and ever since then she has been able to communicate with dead people. Sunny (Yoo In Na), the owner
            of a chicken restaurant and Eun Tak’s boss, crosses paths with Wang Yeo and becomes smitten with him. Can Eun Tak be the
            true “goblin bride” with the power to release Kim Shin from his eternal misery? “Goblin” is a 2016-2017 South Korean drama
            series directed by Lee Eung Bok. It is written by Kim Eun Sook, who also wrote the very successful dramas “Heirs” (2013) and
            “Descendants of the Sun” (2016).
